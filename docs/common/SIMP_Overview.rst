The System Integrity Management Platform (SIMP) is a framework designed
around the concept that individuals and organizations should not need to repeat
the work of automating the basic components of their operating system infrastructure.

Expanding upon this philosophy, SIMP also aims to take care of routine policy
compliance to include NIST 800-53, FIPS 140-2, the DISA STIG, and the SCAP
Security Guides.

By using the :term:`Puppet` automation stack, SIMP is working toward the concept of a
self-healing infrastructure that, when used with a consistent configuration
management process, will allow users to have confidence that their systems not
only start in compliance but remain in compliance over time.

Finally, SIMP has a goal of remaining flexible enough to properly maintain your
operational infrastructure. To this end, where possible, the SIMP components
are written to allow all security-related capabilities to be easily adjusted to
meet the needs of individual applications.
