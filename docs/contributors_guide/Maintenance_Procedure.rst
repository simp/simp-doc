Maintenance Procedure
=====================

If you're a SIMP maintainer, you're in the right spot! Otherwise,
you'll want to head over to the 
:ref:`gsg-contributors_guide-contribution_procedure`.

This section exists to document the correct procedure for SIMP
Maintainers to update and release code.  These procedures
are above and beyond the 
:ref:`gsg-contributors_guide-contribution_procedure`.
